Twitter's Bootstrap for Pinax.

Include "pinax-bootstrap-theme" in your requirements file and
"bootstrap_theme" in your INSTALLED APPS.

Make sure both template loaders and staticfiles finders includes
app directories.

Site name comes from Sites fixture.

Your "site_base.html" should extend "theme_base.html" and should provide
"footer" and "nav" blocks (the latter should just be a ul of li of a links).

Your pages should have blocks "head_title" and "body" and should extend
"site_base.html".

The url name "home" should be defined as the homepage.


TODO / ISSUES

* decide if this app should have account styles / templates or put them in
  another app
* build additional apps for other starter projects
* review all block names
* consider using LESS here
* build a forms filter (either in this app or another)
* username on secondary nav has to be an anchor for boostrap styling but if
  there is no profile, what could it link to?
* I've switched account to a sidebar subnav but perhaps we should consider
  a tabbed interface
